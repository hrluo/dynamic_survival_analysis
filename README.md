# Dynamic Survival Analysis

This repository provides a Python implementation of the dynamic survival analysis method. **This is primarily based on a package (available [here](https://github.com/calebbastian/epidemic)) developed by Caleb Deen Bastian, Princeton University.** I acknowledge the help of Saket Gurukar, the Ohio State University, to parallelize some of the routines.
